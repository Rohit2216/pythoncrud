**Problem 41:**

- **Prerequisite**: Understand date and time functions in SQL / MongoDB
- **Problem**: Assuming there's a **`ride_date`** field of date type in the **`Rides`** table / collection, write a query to find all rides that happened in the last 7 days.

FROM Rides
WHERE ride_date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 7 DAY;


const lastSevenDays = new Date();
lastSevenDays.setDate(lastSevenDays.getDate() - 7);

db.Rides.find({ ride_date: { $gte: lastSevenDays } });


**Problem 42:**

- **Prerequisite**: Understand the concept of NULL values and how to handle them in SQL / MongoDB
- **Problem**: Write a query to find all rides where the **`end_location`** is not set.


SELECT *
FROM Rides
WHERE end_location IS NULL;


db.Rides.find({ end_location: { $exists: false } });


**Problem 43:**

- **Prerequisite**: Understand the use of complex mathematical operations in SQL / MongoDB
- **Problem**: Write a query to calculate the fare per mile for each ride and return the ride ids and their fare per mile, ordered by fare per mile in descending order.

SELECT id, fare / distance AS fare_per_mile
FROM Rides;


db.Rides.aggregate([
    { $project: { id: 1, fare_per_mile: { $divide: ["$fare", "$distance"] } } }
]);


**Problem 44:**

- **Prerequisite**: Understand the use of multiple JOINs in SQL / multiple Lookups in MongoDB
- **Problem**: Assuming there's another collection/table **`Passengers`** with **`passenger_id`** and **`name`** fields, write a query to return a list of all rides including the driver's name and passenger's name.


SELECT r.id, d.name AS driver_name, p.name AS passenger_name
FROM Rides r
JOIN Drivers d ON r.driver_id = d.driver_id
JOIN Passengers p ON r.passenger_id = p.passenger_id;


db.Rides.aggregate([
    {
        $lookup: {
            from: "Drivers",
            localField: "driver_id",
            foreignField: "driver_id",
